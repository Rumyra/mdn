## Becoming A Peer

Peers are those that actively help maintain MDN. They triage issues, review pull requests, support contributors and 

Peers usually come from our partners such as Open Web Docs, w3c, Igalia, Google & Microsoft. However anyone can be a peer and anyone can request to become a peer.

### What is expected

Being a Peer means you are expected to dedicate some of your time to triaging issues for other contributors and periodically review pull requests. A Peer will be added to at least one content team, usually in their area of expertise. They are also expected to support and help contributors, as well as abiding by and enforcing the code of conduct.

You can find a list of the different content teams here.

To request to become a Peer, please get in touch with one of our core team members, explaining why you'd like to become a Peer. They will be able to give you more information.

It's usually a good idea to read through the issue triage process and pull request etiquette before doing so to give yourself a good idea of what's involved.


## Platform Requests

Any requests for platform updates or new features, should be raised as an issue on the relevant repository with the label `Engineering request`. Issues are reviewed by owners periodically and can be added to the engineers roadmap. Please provide as much detail about the feature as you can, include how important the request is (for instance whether it's an urgent bug or a nice to have feature).
